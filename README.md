**Project Procedure – UC2: Add Passenger Bogies to Train**

1. **Continue the Project**

Using the existing Java project created in IntelliJ IDE and the class **TrainConsistManagementApp.java**, we extend the functionality to manage passenger bogies.

2. **Display UC2 Title**

Inside the `main` method, display the module heading using console output:

```
==================================
UC2 - Add Passenger Bogies to Train
==================================
```

This informs the user that the application is now performing operations related to passenger bogies.

---

3. **Initialize Passenger Bogie List**

Create a dynamic list to store passenger bogies:

* Use the **List interface** for abstraction.
* Use the **ArrayList class** for dynamic resizing.

```
List<String> passengerBogies = new ArrayList<>();
```

This list will hold different types of passenger bogies.

---

4. Add Passenger Bogies

Add different types of bogies using the `.add()` method:

* Sleeper
* AC Chair
* First Class

```
passengerBogies.add("Sleeper");
passengerBogies.add("AC Chair");
passengerBogies.add("First Class");
```

---

### **5. Display Added Bogies**

Print the list after adding bogies:

```
After Adding Bogies:
Passenger Bogies : [Sleeper, AC Chair, First Class]
```

This confirms successful insertion into the dynamic list.

---

### **6. Remove a Bogie**

Remove a specific bogie using the `.remove()` method:

```
passengerBogies.remove("AC Chair");
```

---

### **7. Display Updated List**

Print the list after removal:

```
After Removing 'AC Chair':
Passenger Bogies : [Sleeper, First Class]
```

This demonstrates dynamic deletion capability.

---

### **8. Check Bogie Availability**

Use the `.contains()` method to verify if a bogie exists:

```
passengerBogies.contains("Sleeper");
```

Output:

```
Contains Sleeper? : true
```

---

### **9. Display Final Passenger Consist**

Print the final state of the passenger bogie list:

```
Final Train Passenger Consist:
[Sleeper, First Class]
```

---

### **10. Completion Message**

Display a confirmation message:

```
UC2 operations completed successfully...
```

---

## **Outcome of UC2**

After completing this procedure:

* Passenger bogies are successfully added to the train consist.
* A specific bogie is removed dynamically.
* The system verifies the presence of a bogie using search functionality.
* Final passenger consist is displayed accurately.
* The application demonstrates effective use of **ArrayList operations** such as add, remove, and contains.

If you want, I can also write **UC3 (e.g., Goods Bogies / Mixed Consist / Sorting / Searching)** in the same format 👍
