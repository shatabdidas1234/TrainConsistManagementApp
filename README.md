## **Project Procedure – UC4: Maintain Ordered Bogie Consist**

### **1. Continue the Project**

Using the existing Java project and class **TrainConsistManagementApp.java**, extend the system to maintain the **physical order of bogies** in a train.

---

### **2. Display UC4 Title**

Inside the `main` method, print:

```
==================================
UC4 - Maintain Ordered Bogie Consist
==================================
```

This indicates operations related to maintaining train sequence.

---

### **3. Introduce LinkedList**

To manage ordered bogies efficiently:

* Use the **List interface**
* Use **LinkedList implementation**

```
List<String> trainConsist = new LinkedList<>();
```

Unlike ArrayList, LinkedList uses **node connections**, making insertions and deletions efficient.

---

### **4. Add Initial Bogies**

Add bogies in sequence using `.add()`:

```
trainConsist.add("Engine");
trainConsist.add("Sleeper");
trainConsist.add("AC");
trainConsist.add("Cargo");
trainConsist.add("Guard");
```

---

### **5. Display Initial Train Consist**

```
Initial Train Consist:
[Engine, Sleeper, AC, Cargo, Guard]
```

This represents the initial arrangement of the train.

---

### **6. Insert a Bogie in the Middle**

Insert **Pantry Car** at position 2 using:

```
trainConsist.add(2, "Pantry Car");
```

---

### **7. Display Updated Consist**

```
After Inserting 'Pantry Car' at position 2:
[Engine, Sleeper, Pantry Car, AC, Cargo, Guard]
```

This demonstrates **mid-list insertion efficiency**.

---

### **8. Remove First and Last Bogies**

Remove bogies from both ends:

```
trainConsist.remove(0); // Remove Engine
trainConsist.remove(trainConsist.size() - 1); // Remove Guard
```

---

### **9. Display Final Consist**

```
After Removing First and Last Bogie:
[Sleeper, Pantry Car, AC, Cargo]
```

---

### **10. Completion Message**

```
UC4 ordered consist operations completed...
```

## **Actor & Flow**

**Actor:** User

**Flow:**

1. User defines bogie sequence
2. System stores bogies in LinkedList
3. Bogies are inserted at specific positions
4. First and last bogies are removed
5. Final ordered consist is displayed

---

## **Key Concepts Used in UC4**

* **LinkedList** – Doubly linked list implementation
* **Node Structure Concept** – Each element links to previous and next nodes
* **add(index, element)** – Insert at a specific position
* **remove()** – Delete elements from list
* **Order Preservation** – Maintains real-world train sequence

---

## **Key Requirements**

* Create a `LinkedList<String>` for train consist
* Add bogies: Engine, Sleeper, AC, Cargo, Guard
* Insert **Pantry Car** at position 2
* Remove first and last bogies
* Display the final ordered train consist

---

## **Key Benefits**

* Models **real-world train arrangement**
* Efficient insertion and deletion compared to ArrayList
* Helps understand **node-based data structures**
* Demonstrates importance of **order maintenance**

---

## **Outcome of UC4**

After completing this procedure:

* Train bogies are maintained in a **strict order**
* Insertions and deletions are handled efficiently
* The system reflects **real-world train composition behavior**
* The application demonstrates effective use of **LinkedList for ordered data management**
